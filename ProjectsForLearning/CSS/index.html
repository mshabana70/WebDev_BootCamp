          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Mahmoud! I am a 23 year old Software developer! I am currently employed full time at Broadridge
            Financial Solutions. I am a former division 1 football player, now retired and living with my family in
            New York City. In my free time, I enjoy working out, boxing, tutoring/mentoring youth and reading books!

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently a programmer! I do it as a hobby, as well as a career path. I am currently learning full-stack
            web development. My current position is a junior developer, but I do full stack developement for a desktop application.
            I believe web development is on the rise with the promise of new system architectures such as Web3.0 and Microservices.
            I hope to join this trend by becoming a proficient full stack web developer.

          <h3>Swimmer</h3>
          <p>
            I am a good swimmer! I have been swimming since I was 7 years old! Competitive swimming from ages 11-15 years old. 
            Swimming was my first sport prior to playing Football. I hope to continue to swim and possibly become better than I
            was at my peak!
