## JavaScript Origins

The beginning of Javascript came about around the time that the popular 90's internet browser declined in popularity. Netscape envisioned a world where instead of webpages staying as static HTML pages where all calculations, animations and business logic was handled on servers and then returned to the browser for rendering. Netscape saw the need for dynamic webpages where user can interact with the webpage and recieve feedback in real-time. So Netscape contracted [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) to create a programming language that would add functionality to webpages, all while being simple enough for non-programmers to handle the language. Internet lore says that it took Brendan 10 days to create the Javascript language.
